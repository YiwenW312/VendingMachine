# VendingMachine

## Summary
This is a self-practice project for design patterns


The goal of the project is to design two Vending Machine components using the Model-Driven Architecture (MDA) and then implement these Vending Machine components based on this design using the OO programming language. This OO-oriented design should be based on the MDA-EFSM for both Vending Machine components that was identified in the first part of the project. In this design, the following OO design patterns are used:
1. state pattern
2. strategy pattern
3. abstract factory pattern
